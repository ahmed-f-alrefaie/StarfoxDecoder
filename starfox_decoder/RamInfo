Intro:

Conerian ships:

Object id found in:

0x7E0448

0x7E069A


Training:

0x7E04B4: Rings

Corneria:

Boxes locations:

0x7E047E

0x7F0091 <--most likely a coincidence.

Arwing:
0x7E033A
0x7E3186 < --- This is the player arwing!!!!!!
0x7E058C <--
0x7E0772 <-- --- Possibly team arwings
0x7E0922 <--


So this is to go on a certain assumption of the way objects are handled.

A possible setup is that there are slots ranging from 0x7E04XX -- 0x7(E/F)9XX
Witht the format

Object-ID
Position X,Y,Z
Rotations X,Y,Z
Possible animation frame index

A discovery is that by applying in Snes9x the cheat:
0x7E3186 val: BCB4 You use the high poly arwing for most of the game.
The only exception is when shifting cockpits in the space levels.

Plan:


Attach to memory location 0x7E3186
Monitor values
