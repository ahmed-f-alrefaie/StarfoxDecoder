Intro:

Conerian ships:

Object id found in:

0x7E0448

0x7E069A


Training:

0x7E04B4: Rings

Corneria:

Boxes locations:

0x7E047E

0x7F0091 <--most likely a coincidence.

Arwing:
0x7E033A
0x7E3186 < --- This is the player arwing!!!!!!
0x7E058C <--
0x7E0772 <-- --- Possibly team arwings
0x7E0922 <--


So this is to go on a certain assumption of the way objects are handled.

A possible setup is that there are slots ranging from 0x7E04XX -- 0x7(E/F)9XX
Witht the format

Object-ID
Position X,Y,Z
Rotations X,Y,Z
Possible animation frame index

A discovery is that by applying in Snes9x the cheat:
0x7E3186 val: BCB4 You use the high poly arwing for most of the game.

0x7E318A / 0x7E033A <--Ram locations for no right wing arwing.
It seems like these two ram locations must be set for the arwing change to apply when losing wings





The only exception is when shifting cockpits in the space levels.

-------Newer discovery has show that the object ids may be grouped together----
At least for the player





Plan:


Attach to memory location 0x7E3186
Monitor values
